# AshJava

This is a port of the [Ash Entity System](http://www.ashframework.org/). Though
not a true 1 to 1 copy, it resembles the same structure and layout.

```java
entity = new Entity().add(new Position(0,1)).add(new Display("something"));
engine.add(entity);
```

## Current Status

Under construction and needs a ton of help. If you want to help out, get in
touch with me or fork this project and send pull requests. All are welcome!
